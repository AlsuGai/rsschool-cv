### Briefly About Myself:
I am a frontend developer with higher education in economics.
I love learning and learning something new. My interest in IT began with the fact that at
my current job I started filling the content of our organization's website and
having studied the IT field on my own, I realized that this area is multifaceted and constantly
developing.
Having gone from the backend (JAVA) to the front-end in training, I realized that developing cool
user interfaces is what I'm really interested in.
I have quite a lot of experience in the field of finance, and also have experience
UI design, I will be glad to use my previous experience in my new field.
In my free time, I develop my self-development, as well as my physical health.
